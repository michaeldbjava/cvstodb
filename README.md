# csvtodb
This is the very beginning of deployment of a little helper application which has only one task. 
This task consists of the import of a CSV file to a table of relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL or MS-SQL-Server. 

Future Request could be:
+ Create table if no aim table is defined
+ Send confirmation if import is finished
+ It should be possible to configure output to standard output or an output file
